          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Rainhero Games is committed to ensuring that the
            app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
            reserve the right to make changes to the app and website or to
            charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will
            never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
            clear to you exactly what you&rsquo;re paying for.
          </p>

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Application stores and processes personal data
            that you have provided to us, to provide my Service. It&rsquo;s your
            responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We
            therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone,
            which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.
            It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
            programs, compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features and it
            could mean that the Application won&rsquo;t work properly or at all.
          </p>

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;You should be aware that there are certain things
            that Rainhero Games will not take responsibility for. Certain
            functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet
            connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile
            network provider, but Rainhero Games cannot take responsibility for
            the app not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t have
            access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t have any of your data allowance
            left.
          </p>

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If you&rsquo;re using the app outside of an area
            with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
            your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
            duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other
            third-party charges. In using the app, you&rsquo;re accepting
            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges
            if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
            country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill
            payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the app, please be
            aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
            payer for using the app.
          </p>

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Along the same lines, Rainhero Games cannot always
            take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
            make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of
            battery and you can&rsquo;t turn it on to avail the Service,
            Rainhero Games cannot accept responsibility.
          </p>

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With respect to Rainhero Games&rsquo;s
            responsibility for your use of the app, when you&rsquo;re using the
            app, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor
            to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on
            third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it
            available to you. Rainhero Games accepts no liability for any loss,
            direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on
            this functionality of the app.

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At some point, we may wish to update the app. The
            app is currently available on Android &ndash; the requirements for
            the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
            availability of the app to) may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to
            download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Rainhero
            Games does not promise that it will always update the app so that it
            is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you
            have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
            updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
            stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time
            without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
            otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
            to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and
            (if needed) delete it from your device.

          <p class="contentbodydata">
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In addition to all third-party obligations, the
            following shall apply. In no way can Virtual Currency or Virtual
            Items be exchanged with us or anyone else for real money, goods,
            other items, or services of monetary value. Transferring Virtual

            meaning that you may not buy or sell Virtual Currency or Virtual

            Rainhero Games discontinues its Games, you forfeit any and all
            Virtual Currency and Virtual Items earned or purchased. Rainhero
            Games has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify,
